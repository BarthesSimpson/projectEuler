/*
Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

// I didn't code a solution for this because it is a simple combinatorics
// problem (40 choose 20). The general solution is 2m choose m, because
// for each square along the diagonal (total m) there are two possible moves
// (total 2m), only one of which (total m) brings you closer to the goal.

// Were I coding a solution, some kind of DP or divide & conquer approach
// would make sense.

// Update: Here's an elegant DP solution
