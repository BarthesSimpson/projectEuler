# Project Euler Solutions (ES6)

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) has a bunch of math problems that I plan to tackle in my (endangered, possibly extinct) spare time.

## Getting Started

The solutions can be run using `node {/path/to/solution/}`. Helper functions have unit tests that require Jasmine as a dependency, so if you want to run those you need to run `npm i` (one time) to install that. Then run `npm test` to execute the tests.
